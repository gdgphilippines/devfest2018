# Project Management

This document describes the proper way of implementing the project that is properly tested, documented, and communicated with peers in the project due to a standard way of coding and communicating.

Here we will suggest the [Development Environment](Development-Environment.md) to use (optional), and then start off with the necessary [tool requirements and how to install them](Requirements.md). After that, we will talk about [forking and cloning the project to your computer](Forking-and-Branching.md), [describe the project structure](Project-Structure.md), [installing its dependencies](Installation.md), and [commands to run and build the program](Running.md). We will also talk about [commit conventions](Commit.md) and doing a [Pull request](Pull-Request.md). Lastly, we also have our own small criteria on doing a [code review](Review.md).
