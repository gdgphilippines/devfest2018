# Installing Dependencies

Once you have your branch ready, install new or old dependencies on the project for it to run.

```
npm i
```

For those who will be working on the backend (Firebase functions), make sure you are running in Node Version 6

```
nvm use 6
```

And then go to the functions folder

```
cd functions
```

And then install

```
npm i
```

Once done, make sure you go back to the project's root folder.

After that, we are done :)

## What's next?

It's time to [run the project](./Running.md)...
